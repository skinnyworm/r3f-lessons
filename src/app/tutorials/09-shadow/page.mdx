## 9. shadow

We are going to use react-three-fiber to create a simple scene with a box and a plane. The box will cast a shadow on the plane, 
and the plane will receive the shadow. We will also add some lights to the scene to make it look more realistic.

```tsx

type THREE3DObjectRef = React.RefObject<THREE.Object3D>;

const Scene = () => {
  const pointLightRef = useRef<THREE.PointLight | null>(null);
  useHelper(pointLightRef as THREE3DObjectRef, THREE.PointLightHelper, 0.2, "red");

  return (
    <>
      <PerspectiveCamera position={[0, 2, 6]} makeDefault />
      <ambientLight intensity={0.3} />
      <pointLight ref={pointLightRef} position={[2, 2, -1]} color="white" castShadow />
      <Box />
      <Plan />
      <axesHelper args={[1]} />
      <OrbitControls />
    </>
  );
};
```
