Loading 3D Models
=================


### Using 3D modeling software or AI to build assets

Most of the 3D models are created in 3D modeling software like Blender, Maya, or 3DS Max. These models are then exported to a file format 
that can be used in a game engine or other 3D application. Loading 3D models into your application allows you to create complex scenes and 
environments, as well as animate characters and objects. 

### Formats

There are hundreds of different formats for loading 3d models. The most common ones are:

- **OBJ** - Wavefront OBJect file format is a simple data-format that represents 3D geometry alone.
- **FBX** - The FBX file format, short for FilmBox, is a widely used 3D data interchange format primarily used in the entertainment industry, 
including video games, movies, and VR applications. Developed by Kaydara and acquired by Autodesk, it's a versatile format for storing 
3D models, animations, and related digital assets. 
- **STL** - Standard Tessellation Language or Stereolithography, is a file format commonly used for **3D printing**.
- **PLY** - Polygon File Format or Stanford Triangle Format
- **COLLADA** - Collada is an interchange file format for interactive 3D applications. It is an open standard maintained by the Khronos Group.
- **3DS** - 3D Studio
- **GLTF** - GL Transmission Format. It's made by the Khronos Group (the guys behind OpenGL, WebGL, Vulkan, Collada and with many members like AMD / ATI, Nvidia, Apple, id Software, Google, Nintendo, etc.)

### GLTF 

GLTF has become very popular these past few years. Inside the glTF file, you can find all the information about the 3D model,including:

- geometries 
- materials 
- cameras
- lights
- scene graph
- animations
- skeletons
- morphing 
- multiple scenes

glTF is a versatile format that can be used for a wide range of applications for different use cases. It is particularly well-suited for real-time rendering.

- **glTF**: A JSON-based format that can be easily parsed and manipulated by JavaScript applications.
- **glTF-binary (glb)**: A binary version of glTF that is more efficient for transmission and storage. It is a single file that contains all the data needed to render a 3D model, including textures and animations.
- **glTF-embeded**: Binary data is embedded in the JSON file, which can make it larger and less efficient for transmission. All assets in a signle file, using base64 encoding to encode binary data.
- **gltf-draco**: A compressed version of glTF that uses the Draco compression algorithm to reduce the size of the file. This can be useful for reducing load times and improving performance in web applications.

### Loading model with react-three-fiber

<Example1/>

Loading 3D models in react-three-fiber is very easy. You can use the `useGLTF` hook to load a glTF model. The `useGLTF` hook takes a URL as an argument and returns an object that contains the loaded model. 
You can then use the `primitive` component to render the model in your scene. 

- Put the model and its loading loging logic in a separate component.
- **Laze loading** - use `<Suspense>` to wrap the model component. This will allow you to show a loading state while the model is being loaded.
- The model contains variant nodes and other assets, which can be added to the scene.

```tsx
"use client";

import { AspectRatio } from "@/components/ui/aspect-ratio";
import { Box, OrbitControls, useGLTF } from "@react-three/drei";
import { Canvas, Vector3 } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { Suspense } from "react";

export const Example1 = () => {
  return (
    <AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9} className="bg-muted">
      <Canvas camera={{ position: [-5, 5, 5], fov: 45 }} shadows>
        <color attach="background" args={["#000"]} />
        <OrbitControls makeDefault={true} />

        <ambientLight intensity={0.6} />
        <directionalLight position={[5, 10, 5]} intensity={3} />

        <Box args={[10, 0.5, 10]} position={[0, -0.25, 0]} rotation={[0, 0, 0]} receiveShadow>
          <meshStandardMaterial color="white" />
        </Box>

        <Suspense fallback={<PlaceHolder />}>
          <Helmet />
        </Suspense>
        <axesHelper args={[3]} />
      </Canvas>
    </AspectRatio>
  );
};

const Helmet = ({ position, scale = 3 }: { position?: Vector3; scale?: number }) => {
  const model = useGLTF("/FlightHelmet/glTF/FlightHelmet.gltf");  
  return <primitive object={model.scene} position={position} scale={scale} />;
};

const PlaceHolder = () => {
  return (
    <Box args={[1, 1, 1]}>
      <meshStandardMaterial color="white" wireframe />
    </Box>
  );
};

```

### Preloading models

In many cases, you don't need to put the model on the stage until some condition was satisfied (eg. enter a room). In such cases, You can use 
the `useGLTF.preload` function to preload a model. This will load the model in the background and cache it for later use. The function will be
invoked when the component is imported. But it is until the component is mounted that the model will actually be instantiated. The preload function
actually loads the model and caches it for later use. This can be useful for reducing load times and improving performance in web applications.

`Helmet.tsx`

```tsx
import { useGLTF } from "@react-three/drei";
import type { Vector3 } from "@react-three/fiber";

const Helmet = ({ position, scale = 3 }: { position?: Vector3; scale?: number }) => {
  const model = useGLTF("/FlightHelmet/glTF/FlightHelmet.gltf");  
  return <primitive object={model.scene} position={position} scale={scale} />;
};

useGLTF.preload("/FlightHelmet/glTF/FlightHelmet.gltf")
```


### GLTF to component

When we use `primitive` to staging the model, we actually put everything in the model into the scene. What if we only want to put a part of the model or we want to 
scale and position mesh individually? Just like we manually create the scene using primitives like box, ring and plane.

Actually we can construct a components with parts loaded from the gltf model. There are even tools help us the generate the jsx files from the gltf model. 

- [gltfjsx](https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx) is command line tools that can convert glTF files to React components. 
- https://gltf.pmnd.rs/ is a web-based tool that can convert glTF files to React components.

<Example2/>

`hamburger.tsx`

```tsx
/*
Auto-generated by: https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx
*/

import { useGLTF } from "@react-three/drei";
import React from "react";

export function Hamburger(props) {
  const { nodes, materials } = useGLTF("/hamburger.glb");  
  return (
    <group {...props} dispose={null}>
      <mesh castShadow receiveShadow geometry={nodes.bottomBun.geometry} material={materials.BunMaterial} />
      <mesh
        castShadow
        receiveShadow
        geometry={nodes.meat.geometry}
        material={materials.SteakMaterial}
        position={[0, 2.817, 0]}
      />
      <mesh
        castShadow
        receiveShadow
        geometry={nodes.cheese.geometry}
        material={materials.CheeseMaterial}
        position={[0, 3.04, 0]}
      />
      <mesh
        castShadow
        receiveShadow
        geometry={nodes.topBun.geometry}
        material={materials.BunMaterial}
        position={[0, 1.771, 0]}
      />
    </group>
  );
}

useGLTF.preload("/hamburger.glb");
```

#### Fixing shadow

In the hamburger model, each mesh case showdow and receive shadow. The surface of the hamburger is not flat, so the shadow is not correct(eg. the project shadow on itself). 

To fix this, we can set the directionalLight `shadow-normalBias` property to a higher value. This will make the shadow more accurate and reduce the self-shadowing effect. 

```tsx
<directionalLight ref={directionalLightRef} position={[3, 3, 3]} intensity={2} shadow-normalBias={0.04} castShadow/>
```

### Animation

A glTF model can contain animations. You can use the `useAnimations` hook to load and play animations. The `useAnimations` hook takes a glTF model as an argument and 
returns an object that contains the loaded animations. You can then use the `useFrame` hook to update the animation on each frame.



<Example3/>

```tsx
import { useAnimations, useGLTF } from "@react-three/drei";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export const Fox = () => {
  const fox = useGLTF("/Fox/glTF/Fox.gltf");
  const animations = useAnimations(fox.animations, fox.scene);
  console.log(animations);

  useEffect(() => {
    const action = animations.actions.Run!;
    action.play();
  }, []);

  return <primitive object={fox.scene} scale={0.02} position={[0, 0, 0]} rotation-y={0.3} />;
};
useGLTF.preload("/Fox/glTF/Fox.gltf");
